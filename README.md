## Installation
To run this demo you will need NodeJS and NPM. We recommend doing it through NVM (Node Version Manager)

    cd ~
    wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.31.1/install.sh | bash

Close the terminal and reopen it again. After that install the last version of NodeJS adn set it as default.

    nvm install node
    nvm alias default node

After that, we have to install the different dependencies through NPM. From root folder execute:

    npm install

## Execution
Once the installation process has finished succesfully, just run it through:

    npm start

The demo will be accessible using a web browser in http://localhost:8080
